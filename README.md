## About this project
This project is the week 5 capstone project of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science).

## What do we do in this project

In this project, we are trying to explore the similarity between neighborhoods in Manhattan and Seattle.

The stakeholders of this project would be talents living in Manhattan who are thinking about starting a new IT career(especially AI) in Seattle.

To complete this task, we will do the following steps in this project:

- Collecting data: Including Manhattan neighborhood data, Seattle Neighborhood data, venues nearby each neighborhood which will be generated by Foursquare API.
- Exploratory data analysis to better understand our working dataset
- Creating Map of Manhattan and map of Seattle with Folium library.
- Clustering of the neighborhoods: We will use K means clustering machine learning algorithm since it is fast and especially when there are too many variables.
- Presenting the clustering result on the map
