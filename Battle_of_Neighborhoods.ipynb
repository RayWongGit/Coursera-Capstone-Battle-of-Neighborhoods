    "## Introduction\n",
    "We make decisions everyday, big or small, right or wrong. And every decision we made, makes us who we are.   \n",
    "In year 1994, a 30-year-old young man decided to leave his lucrative job on Wall Street. He drove across the country all the way to Seattle and started an online bookstore. He named it Amazon. And the young man is Jeff Bezos. As he revealed later, he made this decision because of a report forecasting the rapid growth of Internet, also because of the fear of regret later in life.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Today due to the gold rush of AI, there is an urgent need for qualified IT talents. Many smart minds, including those Wall Street workers of course, may be thinking about starting a new career in one of those cities full of tech giants. But transferring to a new career, moving to a new city itself is already very challenging, of course we would hope the new neighborhood we are moving to is similar to the one that we have been living in, so that it won't take us too long  and too much to adapt to the new environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are trying to solve such a problem. We are going to to explore the similarity between neighborhoods in Manhattan and Seattle, trying to come up with some insights as a reference to which neighborhood in Seattle should one choose if he is moving from a neighborhood in Manhattan to Seattle. \n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this task, we are going to use Foursquare location data to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood and then based on this we will group the neighborhoods in clusters with k-means clustering Machine Learning Algorithm, and present the clustering result on a map generated with Folium library.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder why Seattle, why not Silicon Valley. Well, not only just because it is the headquarter of Amazon(one member of the 1 trillion dollar club), it is also the headquarter of Microsoft(another member of the 1 trillion dollar club), Zillow, Tableau, Expedia, etc. Other big tech companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter all have offices in Seattle. What's more, the living cost, especially the housing price is so friendly if compared with that in Silicon Valley. Not to mention the first Starbucks in Pike Place could be a big attraction to the coffee fun. Actually, even Starbucks is actively using AI, especially data science to strengthen its power. So if you are one of those Talents, make sure you take Seattle as an option before you make you decision."
